* Try to use the controller -> service -> dao object chain of method calls instead of invoking dao functions directly
from the main launch file as is being done right now.
* Add test cases for customer controller, service, and dao. Start with dao since that might be easiest.
* Add initial UI.
* Switch to JPA instead of JDBC
* Should methods like delete and insert etc, when invoked via the controller's endpoints return certain http codes
as well as textual responses to indicate success or failure of the requested operations? For example should the delete
method in the customer dao return a boolean to indicate successful deletion of the requested record? And if so, should
this be propagated towards the presentation layer via the service and the controller's calling calling methods and hence
be seen as a response in something like Postman while testing?
* For updating an existing customer via Postman, is it better practice to provide the target customer's id as a url
parameter, or as part of the posted JSON body.


Fun stuff

* See what app looks like in jvisualvm and jconsole.
