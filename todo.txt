1. How do we make h2 file based instead of mem based? Do we need this? In other words every time the system starts up,
do we want it to create the db afresh? Or retain operations from each run of the system? Create-drop vs. Update?
2. Come up with tables (schema) for Rickshaw and write a create/populate sql script for h2.
3. Once schema is in place, how do we handle entity relationships at the code level? They'll already exist in the db
level via keys and maybe join tables.
